## Objectives

My objectives are for the team to tell great longfrom stories and service articles within a theme intended for a defined audience.

## Theme

1985 to 2004: General-interest magazine, first about Gainesville, then about campus.

2004 to present: Class picks one theme, all stories fall under that theme (coverage area can be as broad as all of state, or as narrow as one specific geo area, such as Gainesville or North-Central Florida).

* Previous themes:
* Noise
* Guts
* Fire & Ice
* Play
* Fear
* Night
* Dirty
* Sweat
* Skin
* Black
* Danger
* Secrets
* Senses
* Sins
* Food
* Water
* Weird 
* Alternative
* Art

Stay away from (as overall themes): Sports, music, general campus (but these stories are ok as part of a larger theme)

## Goals

* My goals are for every person to tell one compelling story and explain one interesting thing. 
* You get to pick the channels and metrics.

## Evaluation 

See the syllabus.
